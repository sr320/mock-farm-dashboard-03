</p>

SHIELD is a lightweight web dashboard for exploring how stress-hardening
treatments perform across Pacific Northwest shellfish outplant sites. It brings
together real RobertsLab field observations, in-situ temperature logger records,
and near-live public environmental feeds so users can compare growth, survival,
temperature, site conditions, and treatment outcomes in one browser-based view.

The app is built with React, Vite, Recharts, Leaflet, and React Router. It is
deployed as a static single-page app, with data prepared ahead of time by build
scripts rather than by a runtime application server.

## Website

- Public dashboard: <https://sr320.github.io/mock-farm-dashboard-03/>
- Research overview: <https://sr320.github.io/mock-farm-dashboard-03/research>

The website now includes four main views:

| Route | View | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `/` | Dashboard | Filter field observations, compare treatments and sites, inspect time-series charts, and export field summaries |
| `/map` | Site Map | Explore outplant locations, site summaries, and links back into filtered dashboard views |
| `/live-data` | Live Data | Review near-live environmental observations, source metadata, maps, and OSEL-score context |
| `/research` | Research Overview | Share project objectives, collaborators, Washington Sea Grant support, and research context |

## Purpose

The dashboard is intended as a shareable research and collaboration interface
for the RobertsLab *Crassostrea gigas* stress-hardening outplant program. It
helps users:

- Compare survival and growth across hardening treatments and farm sites
- Inspect long-running HOBO logger temperature records by site
- View geographic site summaries on an interactive map
- Check near-live environmental context from nearby observing stations
- Export the currently filtered field summary for reporting
- Share a direct research overview page with project objectives, personnel, and
  funding context

## How It Works

SHIELD has no browser-facing backend. The deployed site loads committed JSON
bundles from `src/data/` and renders them entirely in the React app.

The backend-like work happens before deployment:

- `scripts/build_real_observations.py` reads RobertsLab observation files and
  writes `src/data/realObservations.json`.
- `scripts/buildArchivalTemperature.mjs` downloads high-frequency HOBO logger
  CSVs, aggregates them to daily mean/min/max water temperature, and writes
  `src/data/archivalTemperatureData.json`.
- `scripts/build_live_temperature.py` fetches recent public environmental
  observations from nearby NOAA, USGS, and NANOOS-matched sources and writes
  `src/data/liveTemperature.json`.
- `.github/workflows/live-temperature.yml` refreshes the live environmental
  snapshot hourly and commits it only when the JSON changes.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds the static app and deploys the `dist/`
  artifact to GitHub Pages.

This design keeps the public site simple to host on GitHub Pages while still
allowing scheduled server-side data refreshes for sources that cannot be fetched
directly from the browser because of CORS or credential constraints.

## Data

The historical placeholder dataset has been replaced with real observation
records. The `mockShellfishData` export name remains for component compatibility,
but it now points to `src/data/realObservations.json`.

Current committed data summary:

| Dataset | File | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Field observations | `src/data/realObservations.json` | 74 site x treatment x assessment-date records generated from RobertsLab outplant data and Baywater 10K-Seed survival anchors |
| Archival temperature | `src/data/archivalTemperatureData.json` | Daily water-temperature summaries aggregated from approximately 15-minute HOBO logger records |
| Near-live environment | `src/data/liveTemperature.json` | Recent matched observations and source metadata for temperature, tide, wind, pressure, streamflow, and chlorophyll source matches |
| Site metadata | `src/data/mockShellfishData.js` | Site coordinates, regions, descriptions, colors, filter helpers, and chart aggregation helpers |

### Sites

- Baywater, Thorndyke Bay / Hood Canal, Washington
- Sequim Bay, Washington
- Goose Point, Palix River / Willapa Bay, Washington
- Westcott, Westcott Bay / San Juan Island, Washington
- Dabob Bay is included in the near-live environmental panel as an
  environmental-only context site

### Treatments

- Control
- Heat primed
- Freshwater primed
- Immune primed
- Combined stress primed

### Metrics

- Growth, in millimeters shell height where measured
- Survival, as percent surviving where measured
- Water temperature, in degrees Celsius from in-situ logger monthly means for
  field observation rows and daily means for the archival temperature chart
- Near-live environmental context, including water temperature, air temperature,
  air pressure, wind, tide height, tide predictions, salinity/conductivity where
  available, streamflow, and chlorophyll source matches

See `docs/DATA_FORMAT.md` for the observation schema and integration notes.

## Deploy To GitHub Pages

This project is configured for GitHub Pages with base path
`/mock-farm-dashboard-03/`, which must match the repository name.

Deployment uses the official GitHub Pages Actions flow in
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Do not use branch-based deploy from `main` or
`docs/`; that serves source files and can cause blank pages or workflow
conflicts.

### One-Time GitHub Pages Setup

1. In the repository, go to **Settings -> Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment -> Source**, choose **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main`; the workflow builds `dist/` and deploys automatically.

The site will be available at:

```text
https://<your-username>.github.io/mock-farm-dashboard-03/
```

For this repository, the direct research page is:

```text
https://sr320.github.io/mock-farm-dashboard-03/research
```

You can also trigger a deploy manually from the **Actions** tab:
**Deploy to GitHub Pages** -> **Run workflow**.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Workflow fails on "Deploy to docs/" | Old branch-based workflow conflicting with GitHub Actions | Use the current Pages workflow and set Pages source to **GitHub Actions** |
| Blank white page | Pages serving the repository root or `/docs` instead of the Actions artifact | Set Pages source to **GitHub Actions** |
| 404 on JS/CSS files | Wrong base path in `vite.config.js` | `base` must match repo name: `/mock-farm-dashboard-03/` |
| `/map`, `/live-data`, or `/research` route 404 | Missing SPA fallback | Build copies `index.html` to `404.html` automatically |
| Intermittent deploy failures | Concurrent pushes racing to deploy | The workflow uses concurrency control; re-run the failed job if needed |

### Important: Repository Name

The Vite `base` path must match the GitHub repository name. It is currently set
to `/mock-farm-dashboard-03/`. If you rename the repo, update `base` in
`vite.config.js`:

```js
base: '/your-repo-name/',
```

The React Router basename is derived automatically from this setting.
