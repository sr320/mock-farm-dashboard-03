          <p>
            Together, these awards support a connected research program on
            oyster climate resilience, from conditioning larvae and broodstock
            in hatchery settings to evaluating survival and performance after
            deployment at commercial grow-out sites. New related work extends
            this conditioning framework to Manila clams and basket cockles,
            linking laboratory priming experiments with field performance at
            partner sites.
